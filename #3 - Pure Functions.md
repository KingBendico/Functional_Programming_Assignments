# 3 Purity



### When can a function be defined as pure?

Pure functions are functions, whose application have no effects beside their output, and must not depend on variables other than the arguments passed to them.

```haskell

```

### What is a side effect?

- when to avoid
- when to embrace

A side effect is when a function modifies something outside of itself.

Usually, side effects are to be avoided in functional programming. But certain actions, such as I/O operations, require side effects.

```haskell

```
